HOW TO ADD YOUR PHOTO
======================

Option 1: Add Photo File (Easiest)
-----------------------------------
1. Find a professional photo of yourself
2. Save it as: profile-photo.jpg
3. Upload it to your GitHub repo (same place as the other files)
4. Done! It will appear on your home page

Requirements:
- File name: profile-photo.jpg (exactly)
- Format: JPG or PNG (rename to .jpg if PNG)
- Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger
- Professional headshot works best


Option 2: Use Photo from Another Website
-----------------------------------------
If your photo is already hosted elsewhere (Google Drive, university website, etc.):

1. Get the direct image URL
2. Open index.html in a text editor
3. Find this line (around line 32):
   <img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Prof. Shlomo Hareli" class="profile-photo">

4. Replace "profile-photo.jpg" with your full image URL:
   <img src="https://your-photo-url-here.jpg" alt="Prof. Shlomo Hareli" class="profile-photo">

5. Save and re-upload index.html to GitHub


Option 3: No Photo (Remove Photo Section)
------------------------------------------
If you prefer no photo:

1. Open index.html
2. Delete lines 31-41 (the entire profile-section div)
3. Keep just the about-box with your text
4. Save and re-upload


NEED HELP GETTING YOUR PHOTO URL?
==================================

From Google Drive:
1. Upload photo to Google Drive
2. Right-click → Share → Change to "Anyone with the link"
3. Copy the link
4. Use that URL in index.html

From University Website:
1. Right-click on your photo on the university site
2. Select "Copy image address"
3. Use that URL in index.html


Your site currently expects: profile-photo.jpg
Upload that file to GitHub alongside your other files!
