                <h2>Research Impact</h2>
                <p>Prof. Hareli's research on the social perception of emotions has been featured in various academic and popular media outlets. His work addresses fundamental questions about how we judge others based on their emotional expressions and how these judgments affect social interactions, workplace dynamics, and interpersonal relationships.</p>
                <p>The research demonstrates that emotional expressions serve important social functions, communicating not just internal states but also social information that influences how others perceive us—including judgments about our competence, trustworthiness, dominance, and willingness to help.</p>
