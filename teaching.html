                <h2>Teaching Philosophy and Methodology</h2>
                <div class="about-box">
                    <p>My approach to teaching is grounded in a simple belief: <strong>students should leave the classroom not only with new knowledge, but with the sense that they have experienced something meaningful</strong>. I aim for learning that resonates, something that leaves a mark long after the formal requirements of the course are completed.</p>

                    <p>To achieve this, I design my courses so that students do not merely <strong>learn about</strong> psychological concepts, they <strong>experience</strong> them. Each class integrates hands-on activities, demonstrations, and real-time applications that connect theory to lived experience. I place strong emphasis on active engagement, critical thinking, and personal reflection.</p>

                    <p>A central component of my teaching is the use of <strong>technology-enhanced learning tools</strong>, including <strong>AI guided simulations</strong>, interactive tasks, and web-based platforms. Students participate in online questionnaires, behavioral tasks, and data-driven exercises using their smartphones or tablets. The results are processed automatically and incorporated directly into the lecture, allowing us to analyze class-generated data on the spot.</p>

                    <p>To support this approach, I rely on Google's suite of online applications such as Forms, Sheets, and Slides, combined with specialized add-ins that enable automated data manipulation, instant feedback emails, and dynamic integration of results into class presentations. This method brings the long tradition of experiential teaching in psychology into the modern era of digital and AI-supported learning.</p>

                    <p>My goal is to create a learning environment that is <strong>interactive, evidence based, technologically current, and personally meaningful</strong>—an environment where students feel that what they learn matters both academically and beyond.</p>

                <h2>AI-Enhanced Pedagogy</h2>

                <div class="about-box">
                    <p>I am at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into psychology education, transforming how students engage with complex concepts in emotion perception and social psychology. My approach goes beyond simply using technology—I strategically leverage AI to create active, evidence-based learning experiences that mirror contemporary research practices.</p>
                </div>

                    <strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em;">🎯</span> AI-Guided Teaching Exercises</strong>
                    <p>Students work through structured exercises powered by AI tools, enabling them to explore psychological phenomena interactively. These exercises adapt to student responses and provide immediate, contextual feedback that deepens understanding of emotion perception principles.</p>
